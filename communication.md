## Communication (5 questions)


#### 1. Explain to me a technical concept related to the role that you’re interviewing for.
#### 2. Introduce me to something you’re passionate about.
#### 3. How would you explain an A/B test to an engineer with no statistics background? A linear regression?
  - A/B testing, or more broadly, multivariate testing, is the testing of different elements of a user's experience to determine which variation helps the business achieve its goal more effectively (i.e. increasing conversions, etc..)  This can be copy on a web site, button colors, different user interfaces, different email subject lines, calls to action, offers, etc. 
  > A/B test: An A/B test is a carefully controlled experiment where we want to compare, for example, one ad A vs another ad B in terms of some metric of performance like click-through rate, which is the total clicks over total views of an ad. To do this test, you show a randomly selected group of people ad A, and another random selected group of people ad B. Beforehand, you should have calculated how many people to show either ad to with power analysis, and then when you have shown the ads enough, you can finally compare the click-through rates of ads A and B.
